Jealous Husbands Problem
===============

### solution code in Python

*Three traditional, but jealous, couples need to cross a river. Each couple consists of a husband and a wife. They find a small boat that can contain no more than two persons. Find the simplest schedule of crossings that will permit all six people to cross the river so that none of the women shall be left in company with any of the men, unless her husband is present. It is assumed that all passengers on the boat onboard before the next trip and at least one person has to be in the boat for each crossing.*

The code allows the user to input any number of couples and any capacity for the boat. The user can also select the search strategy to find the solution.  
Supported search strategies are:  
	* Breadth-First Search  
	* Depth-First Search  
	* Greedy Best-First Search  
	* A* Search Algorithm
